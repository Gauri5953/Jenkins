-----------------------------Introduction----------------------------------------
Jenkins and GitHub Actions both allow you to create workflows that automatically build, test, publish, release, and deploy code.
Jenkins and GitHub Actions share some similarities in workflow configuration:

    > Jenkins creates workflows using Declarative Pipelines, which are similar to GitHub Actions workflow files.
    > Jenkins uses stages to run a collection of steps, while GitHub Actions uses jobs to group one or more steps or individual commands.
    > Jenkins and GitHub Actions support container-based builds. For more information, see "Creating a Docker container action."
    > Steps or tasks can be reused and shared with the community.

---------------------------------Key Differences------------------------------------
1) Jenkins has two types of syntax for creating pipelines: Declarative Pipeline and Scripted Pipeline.
             > Declarative Pipeline:- Declarative pipelines are a more recent approach to the “pipeline-as-code” principle ,They are quite easy to write and understand.
                                      The “pipeline” block is the main block that contains the entire declaration of a pipeline. 
                                     # pipeline – contains the whole pipeline
                                     # agent – defines the machine that will handle this pipeline
                                     # stages – declares the stages of the pipeline
                                     # steps – small operations inside a particular stage
             > Scripted Pipeline:- Scripted pipelines were the first version of the “pipeline-as-code” principle. They were designed as a DSL build with Groovy and provide an outstanding level of power and flexibility.
                                   However, this also requires some basic knowledge of Groovy, which sometimes isn’t desirable.These kinds of pipelines have fewer restrictions on the structure.
                                   they have only two basic blocks: 
                                    # Node - A “node” block specifies the machine that executes a particular pipeline.
                                    # Stage - A "stage” blocks are used to group steps that, when taken together, represent a separate operation.

1.1) Jenkins deployments are typically self-hosted, with users maintaining the servers in their own data centers.

2) GitHub Actions uses YAML to create workflows and configuration files.

2.1) itHub Actions offers a hybrid cloud approach by hosting its own runners that you can use to run jobs, while also supporting self-hosted runners.
